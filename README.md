## Online Store System
- A fully interactive, browser-based platform built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL
- It allows users to manage products, customers, and orders through dynamic tables, intuitive forms, and client-side validation
- While maintaining a colorful, engaging, and responsive interface.
- Behind the scenes, the system is designed to follow relational database principles, ensuring meaningful relationships between tables and consistent data integrity
- Every page demonstrates CRUD operations, and the sample SQL script showcases the database schema and initial data for seamless demonstration.
- This project subtly integrates all aspects of the course objectives: from database management to front-end development, styling, interactivity, and usability — without overwhelming the user
- Everything needed to see the system in action, from forms to live tables, is included and documented
- Complte with peding/queued orders and customer
- Show casing different products
- has actual interactive interfaces throughout each formatted scheme

## Quick basic testing methods
1. Use the forms to add new products, customers, or orders.  
2. Tables display **sample data** included in the SQL script (`mini_store.sql`).  
3. For full database functionality, run `mini_store.sql` in MySQL (optional backend connection).

## Challenges & Learning
- **Challenges:** Making the interface lively while keeping it functional, ensuring proper table relationships in the database, and validating forms using JavaScript
- the process of creating repository and adding files was also a foreign concept the first time around
  
- **Learning:** Learned to design a simple relational database, build interactive web pages, and style them to be visually appealing.
